# Express Book Reviews
## Explanation
The wording of tasks 10-13 seemed rather vague at 1:00 in the morning.  The solution that I came up with was to incorporate the static html example from the an earlier project to host proof of the axios calls happening asynchronously.  The page is done in react in the vein of the calculator app.

## Instructions
* fork repo
* run `npm install` in the CLI
* run `npm start` in the CLI to start the server
* In browser, navigate to `http://localhost:5000/axiosCall.html` to see the axios async await function calls in action
